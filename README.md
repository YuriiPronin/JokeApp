# Jokes App üòÑ

A frontend application that displays a list of jokes with the ability to add, delete, refresh and load more ‚Äî built with React, Redux Toolkit and MUI.  
Fully compliant with test task requirements and extended with production-level structure, error handling, and architecture best practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Stack

- **React (TypeScript)**
- **Redux Toolkit**
- **MUI (Material UI)**
- **localStorage**
- **Custom Fetch API with Interceptors**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- üîÑ Load initial jokes (max 10, adjusted if user-added exist)
- ‚ûï Add a new unique joke (stored in localStorage)
- ‚ùå Delete jokes (also clears from localStorage if user-added)
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Refresh a single joke (replaces with a unique one)
- üì¶ Load more (fetch 10 more jokes, no duplication, not saved in LS)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Global error handling (with user-friendly `Snackbar`)
- ‚úÖ Responsive layout with MUI
- üßº Clean architecture with separation of concerns

## üß† Architectural Decisions

- `Redux Toolkit` used for both global state and user-added joke tracking
- LocalStorage integrated manually via `store.subscribe()` + slice segregation
- `addedJokes` are stored and replayed on app load
- `addFromApi` vs `addJoke` separate logic for precise control over persistence
- Custom fetch layer with interceptor for centralized error logic
- Styled via MUI with reusable components like `BaseButton`, `JokeCard`, `JokeActions`
- Snackbar placed top-center for maximum visibility
- Performance-conscious components: used `React.memo`, `useCallback` in key places (`JokeCard`, `JokeActions`, and handler functions) to prevent unnecessary re-renders and ensure scalability

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

## üí° Possible Improvements

- Add unit tests (e.g. for reducers or API utils)
- Persist theme mode (dark/light)
- Use `RTK Query` if API logic gets more complex
- Add filters by joke type or keyword
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA)
  _Note: I'm still learning best practices in accessibility. This is one of the areas I plan to grow in._
